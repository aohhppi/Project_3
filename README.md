# Project_3: Immigrants in Georgia, USA

## Project Background:

Our group decided to analyze the immigrant population groups from different origin that reside in the different counties throughout Georgia. We are drawn to this topic because all members of the group originated from different countries and background and Georgia, USA is our home.  We hope you'll find our project useful.

## Project Objective:

Immigrants migrate to the U.S. for various reasons, such as reunite with family, flee persecution and violence in their home country and pursue new employment opportunities. Understanding the immigrant populations in the state drives better policy decision to enable immigrants to achieve full potential, feel safe and contribute to stateâ€™s economic growth.

## Project Methodology

We drew our dataset from the US Immigrant Population by State (migrationpolicy.org) and applied ETL (Extract, Transfer and Load) to load our data using SQLite database.  We applied the knowledge gained in Flask to export our database to JSON and define our routes and used JavaScript to load our data to HTML.  We then finalized and design our homepage.  The diagram below depicts the methodology followed.

## Project Limitation
- The dataset is limited to the top 15 counties with highest immigrant population in the State of Georgia.
- Given the fact that there undocumented immigrants, the dataset only accounts for documented immigrants captured in USCIS. 
- The dataset only shows cumulative data from 2015-2019 and does not break the population by year. 
- There are overlaps in population count by origin categories.
